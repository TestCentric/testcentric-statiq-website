# About TestCentric Engine

The TestCentric Engine allows test runners to load and run tests and is included with the TestCentric Runner. It may be used independently to develop other test runners. The engine was originally developed as an extension of the NUnit Engine but is now independent of it. Nevertheless, it is still able to execute NUnit tests and to load NUnit Engine extensions.

__TODO:__ Explain how this engine has been enhanced over the NUnit Engine
