# About TestCentric Runner

NUnit V2 came with both a console runner and a GUI. Beginning with NUnit 3, no GUI runner was provided. The TestCentric GUI was developed to fill that need. Version 1 of the runner was similar in appearance of the NUnit V2 GUI. Version 2 has a new look and offers more flexibility in how tests are displayed.

# Versioning

The TestCentric GUI continues to use semantic versioning, with specific exceptions and clarification regarding what is considered a breaking change. See the VERSIONING.md file in the root of the distribution for more information.

# License

The GUI is Open Source software, released under the MIT / X11 license. See LICENSE.txt in the root of the distribution or view it [here](./license.html). The runner uses a modified copy of the NUnit test engine, which is also licensed under the MIT / X11 license.
