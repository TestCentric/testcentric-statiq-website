# Result Tabs

Three tabs along the bottom of the display show the results of running a test.

## Errors, Failures and Warnings

The **Errors, Failures and Warnings** tab displays the error message and stack trace for both unexpected exceptions and assertion failures. Either the raw stacktrace or actual source code for each stack location can be displayed in this tab, provided that the program was compiled with debug information.

## Tests Not Run

The **Tests Not Run** tab provides a list of all tests that were selected for running but were not run, together with the reason.

## Text Output

The **Text Output** tab displays text output from the tests in a format similar to that shown by the console runner, including labels for the tests if specified by the user in the settings dialog.
