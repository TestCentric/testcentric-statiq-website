The Test Properties Dialog is displayed using either the View | Properties menu item on the main menu or the Properties item on the context menu. It shows information about the test and - if it has been run - about the results. The dialog contains a "pin" button in the upper right corner, which causes it to remain open as the user clicks on different tests.

## Header
The header at the top of the dialog shows the status of the test and its name.

If the test has not been run, the status may be one of

* Runnable
* Not Runnable
* Explicit
* Ignored

If the test has been run, it may show any valid result, including

* Passed
* Failed
* Warning
* Skipped
* Inconclusive

**Note:** Some test statuses may include a second field, like `Skipped:Ignored`. This second part is potentially user-extensible, so a complete list is not possible.
