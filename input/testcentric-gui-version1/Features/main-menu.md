## Select Runtime

Displays a list of runtime versions you may select in order to reload the tests using that runtime. This submenu is only present if you have more than one runtime version available.

## Process Model

Allows the user to select how Processes are used loading and running the tests. Note that any selection other than **Default** will override process settings specified in an NUnit or other project file.

* **Default**
The tests use the NUnit engine default, which is **Single** for one assembly, **Multiple** for more than one.

* **In Process**
Tests are run in the same process as the GUI. This is useful for some types of debugging.

* **Single**
Tests are all run in the same process, separate from the process running the GUI itself.

* **Multiple**
Each test assembly is run in its own process, in parallel with other assemblies.

* **Run as X86**
Force the tests to run in a 32-bit process or processes. This setting may be selected in combination with any of the other settings with the exception of **In Process**.

## Domain Usage
Allows the user to select how AppDomains are used in loading and running the tests. Note that any selection other than **Default** will override domain settings specified in an NUnit or other project file.

* **Default**
The tests use the NUnit engine default, which is **Single** for one assembly, **Multiple** for more than one.

* **Single**
Tests are all run in the same AppDomain. When running in process, that AppDomain is separate from the domain in which the GUI itself is running.

* **Multiple**
Each test assembly is run in its own AppDomain. This setting is not permitted when running each assembly in a separate process, since there is only one test assembly per process.

## Recent Files...
Displays a list of recently opened projects and assemblies from which the user is able to select one for opening.

## Exit
Closes and exits the application. If a test is running, the user is given the opportunity to cancel it and or to allow it to continue.
