### TestCentric Runner for NUnit 2.0.0-beta2- September 3, 2023

This release is part of a group of related releases:

- TestCentric Runner 2.0.0-beta2
- TestCentric Engine 2.0.0-beta2
- Net 4.6.2 Pluggable Agent 2.1.1
- Net 6.0 Pluggable Agent 2.1.0
- Net 7.0 Pluggable Agent 2.1.0

Together they form a kind of plateau in the development of TestCentric and a basis for redirecting that development. Specifically, they will be the last releases where the code is constrained to remain compatibility with the NUnit engine and console runner.

At this point, it's clear that the NUnit and TestCentric engines are evolving in somewhat different directions and that re-merging the code is no longer very likely. The next releases of these packages - and other packages - by TestCentric will continue to support a certain degree of compatibility in usage but we no longer anticipate merging the two engines in the future.

Specific features in these releases:

- There is no longer a zip package for the GUI
- Agents may now be run from the command-line. (This is intended for testing and debugging rather than as a substitute for the use of the runner.)

#### Breaking Change

- 986 Eliminate zip package

#### Feature

- 817 Run the agent standalone

#### Enhancement

- 990 Update GUI to match latest builds of the engine, pluggable agents and recipe.

#### Bug

- 987 Need a better message if no agents are available

#### Documentation

- 985 TestCentric.GuiRunner 2.0.0-beta1: no agents in zip package

### TestCentric Runner for NUnit 2.0.0-beta1- May 9, 2023

This is the first beta release of the TestCentric Gui Runner.

The major change from the alpha8 release is that agents are now loaded separately from the engine. All built-in agents have now been removed from the engine itself. This completes our pivot to using pluggable agent extensions for all tests. At this point, the engine alone is no longer capable of running any tests. It's up to the runner making use of the agent to ensure that at least one agent extension is installed. To put it another way: the runner decides what kinds of tests it is capable of running and in what environments, not the engine.

In this release of the GUI, agents for .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET 6.0 and .NET 7.0 are included as dependent packages.. The following additional agents are currently available for user installation: .NET 8.0, .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET Core 2.1, .NET Framework 2.0.

This release was built using the first production release of our TestCentric.Cake.Recipe package.

#### Features

- 977 Add Net70PluggableAgent as a dependency of the GUI
- 978 Add Net60PluggableAgent as a dependency of the GUI
- 979 Add Net462PluggableAgent as a dependency of the GUI

#### Bug

- 974 TestCentric.GuiRunner 2.0.0-alpha8: testcentric.extensibility.dll is missing in net462 agent

#### Build

- 983 Update recipe to production version 1.0.0
- 984 Update engine reference to beta1 release

### TestCentric Runner for NUnit 2.0.0-alpha8- April 25, 2023

This release uses the alpha8 build of the engine and makes extensive use of pluggable agents, which had been available as an experimental feature up to now. Built-in support for the .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5.0 runtimes has been removed and pluggable agents for each of them have been released as separate extensions. Without the extensions, such tests will now be run under .NET 6.0. In addition, tests may now be run under .NET 8.0 using the .NET 8.0 pluggable engine, available as a download from our MyGet feed. That agent is still in pre-alpha development.

The runner is now built using our cake recipe, TestCentric.Cake.Recipe, which was extended in order to support it.

#### Bug

- 945 TestCentric 2.0.0-alpha7: Invalid DisplayStrategy and NullReferenceException

#### Build

- 947 Add test of .NET Core 2.1 Pluggable Agent
- 948 Make build script consistent with that of the Engine
- 951 Add local-only test of .NET 8.0 pluggable agent
- 955 Test with .NET Core 2.1 and .NET 8.0 pluggable agents, version 2.1.0
- 957 Build using TestCentric.Cake.Recipe
- 961 Use TestLevel to reduce number of package tests run
- 967 Convert unit tests to use NUnitLite
- 970 Update to latest engine build; eliminate built-in agents for netcore 3.1 and net 5.0
- 971 Standardize testing of extensions
- 972 Remove pluggable agent tests from build

### TestCentric Runner for NUnit 2.0.0-alpha7- February 6, 2023

### TestCentric Runner for NUnit 2.0.0-alpha5- May 14, 2022

This release includes major revisions to the UI. There is no longer a `Test` menu. Rather, all test execution is performed through the toolbar or the context menu. The toolbar now contains buttons for running all or selected tests, repeating the last run and running only failed tests.

__Note:__ The selected (highlighted) test item in the tree is now referred to as the "Active" item. This is the item for which any detailed information is displayed, as in the properties tab, for example. If `Checkboxes` are enabled, the checked items are referred to as "Selected" for running. If they are disabled, or if no items are checked, the "Active" item is also considered as "Selected".

Reflecting changes in the TestCentric engine, there are no longer built-in agents for .NET 2.0 and .NET Core 2.1. These will be provided by separately installed extensions. The .NET 2.0 Pluggable Agent extension is already available and used in our tests. The .NET Core 2.1 agent is being developed.

### TestCentric Runner for NUnit 2.0.0-alpha1- June 30, 2021

The 2.0.0 release is the first major upgrade of the TestCentric Gui.
It includes a number of breaking changes as well as new features.

#### Significant Gui Changes

- The ProcessModel and DomainUsage menus have been eliminated.

- A new Select Agents menu allows the user to choose a non-default
  agent when more than one is available for a particular assembly.

#### Significant Engine Changes

- In-process execution of tests and the ProcessModel package setting
  are no longer supported. Each test assembly is now run in its own
  separate process.

- The DomainUsage package setting is no longer supported. The runner
  itself decides whether an AppDomain should  be used when running
  on a particular platform.

- All test execution is now performed by agents, which are usually
  separate local processes. Agent selection may be automatic or
  user-specified using a package setting.

- It is now possible to create "pluggable agents" by use of a new
  engine extension point. Currently, this capability is limited to
  local process agents, but it is intended to be extended to other
  agent types in the future.

- Services are now initialized when they are first accessed through
  the service context rather than at startup.

- There is no longer a .NET Standard build of the engine.

- The metadata assembly is now a separate package, which is used
  by the engine.

- X86 builds of .Net Core agents are no longer provided, since
  they are not needed.

#### Breaking Changes

- 664 Replace AppDomain and Process with "Agent" from user perspective
- 656 Pluggable Agents
- 665 Eliminate ProcessModel setting
- 657 Eliminate DomainUsage option
- 444 Eliminate in-process execution

#### Features

- 697 Agent Redesign
- 694 Remove x86 build of agent for .NET Core
- 693 Stop building engine for .NET Standard
- 689 Remove DomainManager as a service
- 684 Make metadata assembly a fully independent package
- 678 Create package for use by pluggable agents

#### Enhancements

- 715 Make dependencies of one service on another explicit
- 677 Update AboutBox for 2.0 release
- 666 Issue an error message when user provides an obsolete project setting. Ignore in project files.

#### Bugs

- 719 Crashing Testcentric on trying to change Process Model to X86
- 707 ResultHelper.Aggregate doesn't count warnings

#### Build

* 729 Allow creation of draft and production GitHub releases for pre-release versions
* 725 Upgrade NUnit framework to 3.12
* 716 Provide test doubles for all services needed for testing.
* 700 Use the GUI to run its own tests
* 699 Create separate test assembly for nunit.agent.core
* 682 Build script should check files for valid headers
