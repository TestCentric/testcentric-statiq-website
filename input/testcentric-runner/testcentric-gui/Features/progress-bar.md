# Progress Bar

The progress bar shows the progress of the test. It is colored according to the "worst" result obtained: red if there were any failures, yellow if some tests were ignored and green for success.

# Result Summary

At the end of the test run, a summary of the results is displayed immediately below the progress bar. If the result information does not fit in the space available, hovering over it shows the full information.
